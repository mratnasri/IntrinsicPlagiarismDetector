Style Change Detection evolves around the task of segmenting and attributing multi-authored documents. 

We chose genuine computer science articles from the ACM digital library that we “plagiarized”with both copied as well as reformulated passages from other ACM computer science articles, contributing to criterion 1. With respect to criteria 2-4, all documentsin the base corpus are represented in XML and validate against an XML schema. The schema declares a mixed content model and provides element types for plagiarism delict, plagiarism source, and other meta information. An XML document with k plagiarized passages defines a template from which 2k instance documents can be generated, depending on which of thek plagiarized parts are actually included. Instance documents contain no XML tags, inorder to ensure that they can be processed by standard algorithms. Instead, a meta information is generated for each, containing information about the exact locations of plagiarized passages.
Note that, based on a lookup-table,the averaged word frequency class of a text passage can be computed in linear time in the number of words. Another salient property is its small variance with respect to text length, which renders it ideal for our purposes.
For the experiments presented here more than 450 instance documents we regenerated each of which containing between 3 and 6 plagiarized passages of differentlengths. During the plagiarism analysis these instance documents were decomposed into 50 - 100 passages from which the feature vectors were computed. the feature set included average sentence length, 18part-of-speech features, average stopword number, values for precision and recall of a series of experiments, where the sizes of the plagiarized passages are successively increased.


The paper investigates methods for intrinsic plagiarism detection and author diarization. We developed a plagiarism detection method based on constructing an author style function from features of text sentences and detecting outliers. We adapted the method for the diarization problem by segmenting author style statistics on text parts, which correspond to different authors.

Research in automatic text plagiarism detection focuses on algorithms that compare suspicious documents against a collection of reference documents. Recent approaches perform well in identifying copied or modified foreign sections, but they assume a closed world where a reference collection is given. This article investigates the question whether plagiarism can be detected by a computer program if no reference can be provided, e.g., if the foreign sections stem from a book that is not available in digital form. We call this problem class intrinsic plagiarism analysis; it is closely related to the problem of authorship verification. Our contributions are threefold.
How likely is the fact that a document d contains a section of another author. We expect that the lengths, the places, and the entire fraction h of such sections depend on particular document characteristics. Hence it makes sense to analyze the document type (paper, dissertation), its genre (novel, factual report, research, dictionary entry), but also the issuing institution (university, company, public service). Algorithmic means to reveal such information interpret document lengths, genres, and occurring named entities.
Table 2 compiles an overview of important stylometric features that have been proposed so far. we distinguish between lexical features (character-based and wordbased), syntactic features, and structural features. Our overview is restricted to the well-known style features and omits esoteric variants.
